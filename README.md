This project is a GLua linter (Garry's Mod LUA) designed to help developers write cleaner and more readable LUA scripts for Garry's Mod.

Garry's Mod is a sandbox game that allows users to create their own scripts in the LUA scripting language.

A linter is a code analysis and parsing tool that ensures code consistency, such as enforcing variable names in camelCase, limiting the number of parameters in functions, and maintaining uniform code structure.
